## Linear Regression Model
Any Linear Regression consists of two variables a) dependent variable b) independent variable\
Y = X1 + X2 + X3\
where, Y == Dependent variable\
       X1,X2,X3 == Independent variable\
Linear regression can be seen as a line in X and Y coordinates which can be used to define the relationship between the dependent variable(y) and independent variables(x)\
y = mx + b

y = a0 + a1x1 + a2x2 + ...... anxn\
-y is the predicted value\
-n is the number of features\
-xi is the ith feature value
-aj is the jth model parameter

## Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Square Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RSME)
